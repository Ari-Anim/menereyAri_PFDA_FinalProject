##Description

   - Create a fun background based on original characters to help promote original stories I have written.
  It will contain an interactive character and background.

##Features
 - Interactive Screensaver with foreground and background
    Created with pygame
 - interactive character within screensaver
    using sprites in pygame and mouse inputs make a character that will try to follow around the mouse
 - have the ability to swap between background styles without changing code
    Unsure of how to execute this yet but will figure it out through documentation

##Challenges
 - Need to figure out how to create a character in pygame
 - Need to to learn how to change between pygame layouts based on user input
 - Need to to learn how to animate a character in pygame

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
 - a dynamic screensaver with a background that can be altered based on user input,
   and which contains a small character that will try to follow the user's mouse,
   as well as a foreground for the character to interact with.

Minimal Viable Outcome: 
 - a dynamic screensaver with a character that can follow the user's mouse and react to some input and a varying background

##Milestones
 - Week of November 2nd
   1.Research possible projects
   2.Prepare project proposal

 - Week of November 9th
   1.Write out Pseudocode and do research on what type of code I need to write for the character
   2.Ideate on character designs and background designs so I know what I need to work towards

 - Week of November 16th
   1.Test between puppet animation using drawings brought into pygame or just fully create the character in pygame
   2.Animate the character using pygame

 - Week of November 23rd
   1.Start having the character follow basic user input
   2.Implement background design
   
 - Week of November 30th
   1.Make background customizable based on user's input
   2.create a small foreground for character to interact with.

 - Week of December 7th
   1. Make sure all files are in git correctly and function on a separate computer to be sure
   2. Submit by December 7th to be carefull of any mishaps with submitting assignments.
