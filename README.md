## Description

This is a custom screensaver made in pygame. The main point of this program is that it has a small character that will try to follow your mouse. There is a toggleable obstacle character who will move across the screen for you to try to jump over. The button that toggles the obstacle on and off is in the top right of the screen. The background is made up of the Grass, Fog, and Background classes. It consists mostly of moving parts though the farthest image in the background class is static, containing the moon, stars and sky. The background can be altered with a button click to change to day.

I had orginally planned and attempted to make working collision between the obstacle sprite and the player sprite. Unfortunately despite trying to get it to work for a very long time it would always end up bugging out, so I had to scrap it. That said I would like to revisit it in the future to see if I can figure out how to fix it, my best guess is that the problem lies somewhere in the character class, though I do not have enough time to rework it.
